# Cat_or_Dog

In this model we train a neural network that can differentiate between cats and dogs. These days it doesn't seem like a big accomplishment, but some years ago it was a serious challenge for computer vision systems.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the `Cat or Dog.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `visuals.py` Python file and the `SmSSpamCollection` dataset file to complete your work.  You will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Cat_or_Dog/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Cat or Dog.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Cat or Dog.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
